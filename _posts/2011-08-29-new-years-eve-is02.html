disc: Minimalist design is something that is getting more fans and adopters. Apple is a big contributor to this change, they have been reducing their hardware design to the barebones of form. That includes packaging as well. There are some industries that minimalism has always been the trend and I feel that interior design and furniture is a good example, especially the upscale tier. D ——— C ——— R is an online shopping for decor UI/UX from the folks over at Adencys and they really do a good job at that.
